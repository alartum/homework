# Projects
I'm glad you visited my repo, stranger!

Here are some projects created for fun and study.

CYL ~ a program that lets you to automatize writing reports in physics. It takes array of data and a formula as input and counts the error of calculation. Then it writes the report into .pdf file and sends to my email (the last feature is just to add some fun).

HashTable ~ some experiments with simple hash functions. Initially was created to bring my own list data structure.

Shared Library ~ some functions and structures I created that are shared between most of the projects.

SolveSquareEquation ~ simple program to practise error handling.

SortByLines ~ just gets text file and sorts its contents according to the end of lines in alphabetical order. As output we get something rhymed.

Test ~ don't know where to put them. They are just small contest programms.

calc ~ text-mode calculator based on recursive descent method.
